        <p>We've come up an AI system that can interpret Braille for visually challenged individuals is an incredible
            tool that
            can help bridge the gap between the visually challenged and the sighted world.
        </p>
        <p>Now for those of you living under a rock, Braille is a writing system invented by Louis Braille in the early
            19th
            century that allows visually challenged individuals to read and write using their fingertips by feeling the
            raised dots
            on a paper or electronic display.</p>
        <p>TouchVision is an AI system designed for Braille interpretation via an application on a personal smartphone
            and
            uploadable on an integrated website for accessing said data on a computer.</p>
        <p>Our AI algorithm is trained on a fairly large dataset of Braille texts, using machine learning techniques to
            recognize
            patterns and learn the language. There is some further scope as this AI will require recognition and
            differentiation
            between different types of Braille characters, such as letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and special
            symbols.</p>
        <p>The system is designed with accessibility in mind for visually challenged individuals and provides vibration
            feedback to
            indicate sensing of the user's touch. A time interval of 1.5 seconds was considered enough for interpreting
            the end of a
            letter, and the same has been implemented in the application as well.</p>
        <p>In addition to interpreting Braille text, the AI system could also provide other features to enhance the
            user's
            experience in the future. For example, it could provide translation services, allowing the user to read
            Braille texts in
            different languages.</p>
