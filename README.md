# Braille

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

With the use of efficient software and hardware we will allow a blind person to read and write using a phone screen. For normal users they can even convert their own text to braille format for printing purposes using an efficient website.

# Objective

As we know that use of mobile phones has made the life easier. Making a prototype by which a blind person can interact with a smart phone by implementing Mobile Application, Machine Learning, Web Application and Hardware. A Blind person can read using The Braille Script on a paper but with the help of the prototype the blind will be able to read and write Braille using a smart phone exposing them to various opportunities around the world. 

The project shall consist of a mobile application, a machine learning model, a web application and hardware.

# Hardware to train the muscle memory of the user

The hardware consists of a plastic case which covers the screen, thus guiding the blind person to trace at the precise location of six black prints (resembling the six dots of the Braille Script).
Designed using Solid Works.

# Mobile Application 

For writing, the mobile application will allow for the person to create black dots on screen in the format of Braille Script on a white board, which is converted to regular text which is then sent to the database.The other way provided is speech to text in which the user will give an audio input which will be converted into a English text output which is then sent to the database.A complimentary feature includes reading in which the text of the pdf file is converted into speech which can be heard by the user.
For building the mobile application flutter tech stack is used.

# Machine Learning Model 

For writing, the application will give the image of the Braille Text written by the user as input parameter to the ML Model. The Model will analyzes the image corresponding to the dataset used for training the model and therefore return the corresponding English Alphabet.

# Website

The website would be used for retrieving the data written by the user and to store it in the database in the format they like or they want it to be. The real-time data will be retrieved to a website so that the required data can be shared for public use such as articles, essays etc. Including that the website also allows users to upload a pdf script in English which will be converted to braille script for easy printing purposes. With the mobile application whatever the user writes will be shown live in the website. We can also add a text to speech recognition model which can read out loud the text that the user is writing so that he has track of his own work.
